I've been studying for the Microsoft Exam [MS 70-480, Programming in HTML5 with JavaScript and CSS3](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/en-us/exam-70-480.aspx). I bought the Microsoft Press study guide of the same title and have been going through all of the examples included in the book. Because I learn more by doing than I do by rote memorization, I have been actually typing out all of the examples by hand.

I've put the resultant code in this repository in case anyone else might find it useful in their study efforts.

Enjoy.

Best Regards,

TQ
